# Astrometric Calibration
Include various work I have done for the prototyping astrometrlic calibration project. This repository includes:

- PrototypingRead.py (used for extracting precise pinhole positions from image data and then performing astrometric calibration)
- Data_read.ipynb (demonstrates the usage of PrototypingRead.py)
- PrototypingSim.py (simulates the performance of the astrometric calibration technique against different distortion fields)
- RecovDistortSim.ipynb (demonstrates the usage of PrototypingSim.py)

The MAVISM module from (https://github.com/smonty93/MAVISIM) might be required for some part of the code.
